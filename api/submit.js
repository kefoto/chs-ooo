/**
 * Receive one session's data: called once per completed room (see
 * js/README.md's block table) and again with the full payload at session
 * end, so a child who disengages partway still has their earlier blocks
 * recorded server-side rather than only in a browser tab that may never save.
 *
 * Requires a ticket from verify-start.js (Authorization: Bearer <ticket>) --
 * Turnstile itself is solved only once, at session start; see _lib/ticket.js
 * for why.
 *
 *     Why Postgres, not Vercel Blob
 *     ------------------------------
 *     Blob's only access mode is "public": anyone with the (unguessable)
 *     URL can read it, no credential required. The payload carries a
 *     child's age, gender, ethnicity, race, handedness and first language --
 *     an IRB expects that behind real access control, not obscurity. Rows
 *     here are reachable only through this API, which is the only holder of
 *     POSTGRES_URL.
 *
 * Every call is an INSERT, never an UPDATE: each block's payload (which
 * already contains every response so far, not just that block's) lands as
 * its own row, so the row with the highest id for a participant is always
 * the most complete one available if the session never reaches "final".
