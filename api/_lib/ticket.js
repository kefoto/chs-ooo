/**
 * Session admission tickets.
 *
 * Cloudflare Turnstile tokens are single-use and expire in a few minutes --
 * fine for gating the START of a session, wrong for authorizing every
 * per-block upload across what can be an hour-plus session (see js/README.md,
 * "Every session runs 550 trials"). So Turnstile is only ever checked ONCE,
 * in verify-start.js, and success there mints a ticket: an HMAC-signed
 * {pid, exp} the browser then attaches to every submit.js call for the rest
 * of the session. This is the same shape as a short-lived signed JWT, just
 * without pulling in a JWT library for two fields.
 *
 * SESSION_TICKET_SECRET must be set as a Vercel environment variable (any
 * long random string) and never shipped to the client -- it is what makes a
 * ticket unforgeable. Rotating it invalidates every ticket issued so far,
 * which only matters for sessions in progress at the moment of rotation.
