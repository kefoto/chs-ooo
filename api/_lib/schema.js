/**
 * The one table this study writes, created on demand.
 *
 * Shared by submit.js and export.js rather than owned by submit.js, because
 * "has the database been set up correctly" is a question you ask BEFORE any
 * session has ever run -- and the answer used to be a Postgres error saying
 * `relation "sessions" does not exist`, which reads as a broken database
 * rather than an empty one. With both endpoints creating it, an export
 * against a freshly connected database returns an empty list, which is the
 * honest answer and a usable health check.
 *
 * No separate migration step beyond setting POSTGRES_URL -- Vercel sets that
 * itself once a Postgres/Neon store is connected to the project.
 *
 * ONE STATEMENT PER CALL. `sql` from @vercel/postgres runs over Neon's
 * HTTP query endpoint, which speaks Postgres's extended (parameterized)
 * protocol -- and that protocol rejects a string holding more than one
 * command: `cannot insert multiple commands into a prepared statement`.
 * Sending the CREATE TABLE and the CREATE INDEX together therefore fails
 * every time, which surfaces as submit.js's 502 "storage unavailable" and
 * a database that never gets its table.

 *
 * A SEPARATE table from `sessions`, and created separately, for two reasons.
 * The obvious one is shape: this holds bytes, not JSON. The one that matters is
 * that `sessions` is what export.js hands out, and these documents must not
 * ride along with a response export -- keeping them in their own table means
 * including them takes a deliberate new query rather than a wider SELECT.
 *
 * UNIQUE (participant_id, form) is what consent.js's ON CONFLICT upserts
 * against: one current document per form per participant, so a session redone
 * after attaching the wrong file leaves one row rather than two with nothing to
 * distinguish them.
 *
 * Same one-statement-per-call rule as above -- see this file's header.
