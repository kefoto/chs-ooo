/**
 * Drives a whole session in jsdom against the REAL jsPsych -- and, unlike the
 * first version of this harness, against the REAL src/main.js.
 *
 * That distinction earned itself immediately. The old harness re-implemented
 * main.js's timeline builder inside the test, so the two could drift, and they
 * did: the copy kept passing while the shipping code wrote jsPsych's global
 * timeline index into `trial_index` (5,6,7,11,12,13,... instead of 0..N-1),
 * because jsPsych reserves that field name and overwrites a plugin's value.
 * A harness that imports main.js cannot drift from main.js.
 *
 * Still not a substitute for opening the page: jsdom renders no pixels and
 * plays no audio.
 *
 *   node js/test/browser.mjs                 # both tiers, as subprocesses
 *   node js/test/browser.mjs "?tier=2&pid=X" # one session, in this process
