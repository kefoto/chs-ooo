 *
 *     BREAKING the session -- `?rooms=abc` used to leave `Num Blocks` NaN and
 *     build a session with zero trials; `?rooms=20000` built 220,000 of them
 *     and locked the tab up for 19 seconds; `?age=abc` quietly ran a
 *     four-year-old through the adult plan. Numbers are now parsed and
 *     clamped, and words are matched against the list of values that mean
 *     something.
 *
 *     CHEATING it -- `?bonus_coins=` is a debug switch that hands out spending
 *     money, and `?rooms=1&trials=1` finishes the study in two taps. The first
 *     is now refused anywhere but a dev host; the second cannot touch a
 *     session that came from CHS.
 *
 *     REDIRECTING it -- see sameOrigin above.
 *
 *     A CHS session is not negotiable
 *     -------------------------------
 *     When CHS hands over a `child`, the identity, the length and the
 *     destination of that session are fixed. A family arriving with extra
 *     parameters bolted on gets the session the study intends: their own
 *     child hash (which seeds the sequence and is the join key back to the
 *     demographic snapshot), the length their age bin calls for, and this
 *     deploy's own endpoint.
